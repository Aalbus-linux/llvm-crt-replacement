########BACKGROUND########

These are crt{1,n,i,begin,end} replacement files from NetBSD [1] via FreeBSD
and the ELLCC compiler [2], re-packaged for simple stand-alone installation.

[1] http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/csu/arch/?only_with_tag=MAIN
[2] http://ellcc.org/viewvc/svn/ellcc/trunk/libecc/src/musl/crt/
[2] http://ellcc.org/viewvc/svn/ellcc/trunk/libecc/src/musl/arch/

########WARNING########

The purpose of these files is to replace the functionality of libgcc in Linux systems where
you want to work with a self-hosting Clang environment. Because of this, these crt files
should only be installed if you want to get rid of gcc/libgcc.
If you for some reason want both these crt files and gcc installed, make sure that
libgcc and the crt files never are in the same LDPATH, because linking will fail due to
duplicate symbols.


########BUILDING########

To build, for example for x86_64 in directory /usr/lib
simply execute TARGET=x86_64 DEST="/usr/lib" ./build.sh

########LICENSE########

All files are under a BSD license, and defined in the header of each file.
